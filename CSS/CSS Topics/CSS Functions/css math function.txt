CSS Maths Functions
Maths functions helps us in fighting dimensions of elements or screen autonomously and thus helps in the responsiveness of a website.

 

Calc() Function
Calculates the value generally width of a particular property.

Eg: width: calc(100%-20px);


This function will automatically subtract 20px from whatever is the 100% width of that container on the website. This way you can space your elements well without hassles.

 

Max & Min Functions
This function takes two parameters and gives the result out of one accordingly.

Eg: width: max(50px, 50%);
Out of these two whichever would be greater, would be assigned as a value to the width; vice versa happens for the minimum function.

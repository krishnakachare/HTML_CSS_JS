By default, inline elementsin HTML do not respect the `width` and `height` properties because they are meant to flow within a line of text and adjust their size automatically based on their content.

# Inline Elements:
  - Do not start on a new line.
  - Only take up as much width as their content.
  - Ignore `width` and `height` properties when applied directly.
    E.g: <span>, <a>, <em>, <strong> 

# Applying `width` and `height` to Inline Elements:
To apply `width` and `height` to an inline element, you need to change its display property:

1. Convert to Block-Level Element:
   Use `display: block;` or `display: inline-block;` to change the behavior of inline elements.
   
   - `display: block;`: The element will behave like a block element, taking up the full width available.
   - `display: inline-block;`: The element remains inline but will respect `width` and `height`.

Example:
    <style>
        .inline-element {
          display: inline-block;
          width: 100px;
          height: 50px;
          background-color: lightblue;
        }
    </style>

<span class="inline-element">This is a span</span>

In this example:
  - The `<span>` element is styled as `inline-block`.
  - It will now respect the `width` and `height` properties.

===================================
Display Property:
Display is used to display certain elements in a container

display: block--> will make an element or elements in a container block.
display: inline ---> will make an element or elements in a container inline
* inline elements cannot have height or width

To make elements inline and use height/width also , we use inline-block

display: table --> will elements in a container as table elements.

display:none will remove the element from DOM such that its space is occupied by next element.

CSS display Property:
The display property in CSS determines how an HTML element is visually rendered in the layout of a web page. It defines the type of box an element generates, affecting its behavior and positioning. The display property can take various values, each with its own characteristics.

Common display Values:

block:
Elements with display: block; generate a block-level box.
Block-level elements start on a new line and take up the full width of their parent container.
Examples include <div>, <p>, <h1>, and <form>.

inline:
Elements with display: inline; generate an inline-level box.
Inline-level elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary.
Examples include <span>, <a>, <strong>, and <em>.

inline-block:
Combines aspects of both block and inline elements.
Inline-block elements do not start on a new line and can have a specific width and height.
Useful for creating inline elements with block-level styling.

none:
Elements with display: none; are not rendered on the page.
They are effectively invisible and do not occupy space in the layout.
Useful for hiding elements dynamically using JavaScript.

flex:
Introduced with CSS Flexbox.
Allows elements to be flexible in their size and layout within a container.
Excellent for creating responsive and flexible layouts.

grid:
Introduced with CSS Grid Layout.
Defines a grid container and its items, enabling complex two-dimensional layouts.

table, table-row, table-cell, etc.:
These values generate elements that mimic the behavior of table elements in HTML.
Useful for creating table-like layouts when actual HTML tables are not suitable.

Additional display Values:

list-item:
Renders an element as a list item.
Typically used with <li> elements within ordered or unordered lists.

inline-table:
Combines aspects of both inline and table elements.
Useful for displaying tables inline with other content.

inherit:
Inherits the display property value from the parent element.
Allows elements to inherit display behavior.

CSS display for CSS Grid and Flexbox:
CSS Grid (display: grid;) and Flexbox (display: flex;) are two modern layout systems introduced in CSS. They offer more advanced and flexible ways to create responsive layouts. When used, they affect the display behavior of their children:
In a CSS Grid container, the children become grid items.
In a Flexbox container, the children become flex items.

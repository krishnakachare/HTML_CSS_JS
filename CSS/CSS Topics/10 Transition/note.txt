CSS Transitions: 
CSS transitions allow you to smoothly change the property values of an element over time. They provide a smooth and gradual change between different states, such as when hovering over a button or fading in an image.

Key Concepts:

Transition Property: To create a transition, you specify the CSS properties that should change smoothly using the transition property.

Example: transition: property duration timing-function delay;

Transition Duration: The duration property defines how long the transition should take to complete.
It's specified in seconds (s) or milliseconds (ms).

Example: transition: opacity 0.5s;

Timing Function: The timing-function property defines the speed curve of the transition.
Common values include ease, linear, ease-in, ease-out, and ease-in-out.

Transition Delay: The delay property specifies a delay before the transition starts.
Useful for creating delayed animations.

Example: transition: opacity 0.5s ease 0.2s;

Shorthand: You can use the shorthand transition property to specify all transition settings at once.

Example: transition: property duration timing-function delay;

Transition Example:
/* Apply a transition to the opacity property */
button {
  opacity: 0.7;
  transition: opacity 0.3s ease;
}
/* Change opacity on hover */
button:hover {
  opacity: 1;
}

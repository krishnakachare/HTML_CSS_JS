`display: flex` Vs `display: inline-flex` :

    # `display: flex` =>
        - The element becomes a block-level flex container.
        - It behaves like a block element, meaning it takes up the full width available by default.
        - It starts on a new line, pushing other elements below it.
        - Use `display: flex` when you want the container to behave like a block-level element.

    # `display: inline-flex` =>
        - The element becomes an inline-level flex container.
        - It behaves like an inline element, meaning it only takes up as much width as necessary and stays on the same line as adjacent elements if thereâ€™s space.
        - It does not start on a new line, allowing other inline elements to sit next to it.
        - Use `display: inline-flex` when you want the container to behave like an inline element but still apply flex properties to its children.

## Hexadecimal numbers work:

# Understanding Hexadecimal Numbers:
    Hexadecimal (or hex) is a base-16 numbering system, which means it uses 16 symbols to represent values. These symbols are:

        - 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 (representing values 0 to 9, just like in the decimal system)
        - A, B, C, D, E, F (representing values 10 to 15)

    In the hexadecimal system:
    - The number `10` in decimal is `A` in hexadecimal.
    - The number `15` in decimal is `F` in hexadecimal.
    - The number `255` in decimal is `FF` in hexadecimal.

# Conversion Between Decimal and Hexadecimal:
    To convert a decimal number to hexadecimal:
    1. Divide the decimal number by 16.
    2. The quotient gives the next digit in hexadecimal (starting from the right).
    3. The remainder gives the current digit.

    For example, to convert the decimal number `255` to hexadecimal:
    - Divide `255` by `16` â†’ quotient `15` (which is `F` in hexadecimal), remainder `15` (which is also `F`).
    - So, `255` in decimal is `FF` in hexadecimal.

# How Hexadecimal is Used in Colors:
    In CSS, colors are represented using three pairs of hexadecimal digits, each pair representing the intensity of red, green, and blue.

    1. Red Component: First two hex digits.
    2. Green Component: Next two hex digits.
    3. Blue Component: Last two hex digits.

    Each component can range from `00` (0 in decimal, meaning no intensity) to `FF` (255 in decimal, meaning full intensity).

# Example Conversions:
    - Red color (`#FF0000`):
    - Red: `FF` (255 in decimal)
    - Green: `00` (0 in decimal)
    - Blue: `00` (0 in decimal)

    - Green color (`#00FF00`):
    - Red: `00` (0 in decimal)
    - Green: `FF` (255 in decimal)
    - Blue: `00` (0 in decimal)

    - Blue color (`#0000FF`):
    - Red: `00` (0 in decimal)
    - Green: `00` (0 in decimal)
    - Blue: `FF` (255 in decimal)

    - Gray color (`#808080`):
    - Red: `80` (128 in decimal)
    - Green: `80` (128 in decimal)
    - Blue: `80` (128 in decimal)

# Total Colors in Hexadecimal:
    Each color component (Red, Green, Blue) has 256 possible values (`00` to `FF`), so the total number of possible colors is:

    \[
    256 \times 256 \times 256 = 16,777,216
    \]

    This gives you over 16 million different color combinations.

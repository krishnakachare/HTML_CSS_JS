CSS units and the box model are fundamental concepts in web development, as they dictate how elements are sized and spaced within a webpage. Let's dive into each concept in detail:

CSS Units:
    Absolute Units:

        Pixels (px): Represents a single dot on a screen. It is a fixed-size unit that does not change with the screen size or resolution.
        div {
        width: 200px;
        height: 100px;
        }

    Relative Units:

        Percentage (%): Relative to the parent element's size.
            div {
            width: 50%;
            height: 50%;
            }

        Viewport Width/Height (vw/vh): Relative to the viewport's width or height.
            div {
            width: 50vw;
            height: 50vh;
            }

        Font-relative Lengths (em, rem): Relative to the font size of the element or the root element (html).
            div {
            font-size: 1.2em; /* 1.2 times the parent element's font size */
            margin: 1rem; /* 1 times the root element's font size */
            }

        Viewport Percentage (vmin, vmax): Relative to the smaller or larger dimension of the viewport.
            div {
            width: 50vmin; /* 50% of the viewport's smaller dimension */
            height: 50vmax; /* 50% of the viewport's larger dimension */
            }

    Other Units:
        Centimeters (cm), Millimeters (mm), Inches (in): Absolute physical units.
        Points (pt), Picas (pc): Typically used in print.

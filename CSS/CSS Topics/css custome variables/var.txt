While it behaves similarly to the html selector, the :root selector has higher specificity and is commonly used to define global styles or CSS custom properties (variables). The styles defined within the :root block will apply to the entire document unless overridden by more specific rules.

<style>
    :root{
        --blue: blue;
    }

    selector{
        color: var(--blue)
    }
</style>

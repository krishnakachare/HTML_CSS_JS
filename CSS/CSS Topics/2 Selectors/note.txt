CSS Selectors:
CSS selectors are used to target HTML elements to apply styles. There are various types of selectors:
1. Type Selector:
The type selector selects elements by their HTML tag name.
It targets all elements of the specified type.
Example:
p {
    color: red;
}
2. Class Selector:
The class selector selects elements with a specific class attribute.
It starts with a dot (.) followed by the class name.
Example:
.button {
    background-color: #008CBA;
    color: white;
}
3. ID Selector:
The ID selector selects a single element with a specific ID attribute.
It starts with a hash (#) followed by the ID name.
Example:
#header {
    font-size: 36px;
    text-align: center;
}
4. Descendant Selector:
The descendant selector selects an element that is a descendant of another element.
It is used to target elements within a specific context.
Example:
ul li {
    list-style-type: square;
}
5. Child Selector:
The child selector selects an element that is a direct child of another element.
It uses the greater-than sign (>).

ul > li {
    font-weight: bold;
}

It is enclosed in square brackets.

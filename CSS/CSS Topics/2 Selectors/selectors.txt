CSS Selectors:
     CSS selectors are used to target HTML elements to apply styles. There are various types of selectors: css style syntax: selectors{
                                        property-name:value;
                                   }

# We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:
    1. Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
    2. Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
    3. Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
    4. Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
    5. Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)
    6. Universal selector(*)

1. Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
    1. Type Selector:
        The type selector selects elements by their HTML tag name.
        It targets all elements of the specified type.
        Example:
                p {
                    color: red;
                }
    2. Class Selector:
        The class selector selects elements with a specific class attribute.
        It starts with a dot (.) followed by the class name.
        Example:
                .button {
                    background-color: #008CBA;
                    color: white;
                }
    3. ID Selector:
        The ID selector selects a single element with a specific ID attribute.
        It starts with a hash (#) followed by the ID name.
        Example:
                #header {
                    font-size: 36px;
                    text-align: center;
                }
    4. Descendant Selector:
        The descendant selector selects an element that is a descendant of another element.
        It is used to target elements within a specific context.
        Example:
                ul li {
                    list-style-type: square;
                }
    5. Child Selector:
        The child selector selects an element that is a direct child of another element.
        It uses the greater-than sign (>).
        Example:
                ul > li {
                    font-weight: bold;
                }
    6. Attribute Selector:
        The attribute selector selects elements with a specific attribute and value.
        It is enclosed in square brackets.
        Example:
                input[type="text"] {
                    border: 1px solid #ccc;
                }

2. Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
     There are four different combinators in CSS:
          1. Descendant combinator (space)
          2. Child combinator (>)
          3. Next sibling combinator (+)
          4. Subsequent-sibling combinator (~)

CSS Grid Layout:
CSS Grid Layout, often referred to simply as Grid, is a powerful two-dimensional layout system introduced in CSS3. It allows you to create complex grid-based layouts with precision, making it an ideal choice for designing web page structures. Grid provides control over both rows and columns, enabling you to create responsive and flexible designs.

Key Concepts:

Grid Container:
To create a Grid layout, you need a grid container, an element that contains grid items.

Apply display: grid; to make an element a grid container.

Grid Items: Grid items are the children of a grid container.
They are the elements you want to place within the grid.
Grid items can be any HTML elements.

Rows and Columns: Grid layouts consist of rows and columns, creating a grid of intersecting lines.
Rows run horizontally, and columns run vertically.

Grid Lines: Grid lines are the lines that define the rows and columns.
They can be referred to by their line numbers or names.

Grid Template: The grid template defines the structure of the grid, specifying the number of rows and columns and their sizes.
You can define the grid template using properties like grid-template-rows and grid-template-columns.

Grid Tracks: Grid tracks are the spaces between grid lines, forming rows and columns.
They can have fixed sizes (e.g., 100px) or be flexible (e.g., 1fr).

Grid Gap: Grid gap is the space between grid tracks, both horizontally (column gap) and vertically (row gap).
It can be defined using properties like grid-column-gap and grid-row-gap.
Placement Properties: CSS Grid provides various properties for placing grid items within the 

layout:

grid-row and grid-column: Specify the position of an item within the grid using grid lines.

grid-area: Assigns an item to a named grid area, defined in the grid template.

grid-row-start, grid-row-end, grid-column-start, grid-column-end: Define the start and end positions for items.

Grid Template Areas: Grid areas are named sections of the grid defined in the grid template.
You can assign items to specific grid areas using grid-area.

Alignment: Grid allows precise alignment of items within the grid container using properties like justify-items, align-items, justify-content, and align-content.
These properties control both horizontal and vertical alignment.

Responsive Design: CSS Grid is ideal for creating responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes.
You can use media queries to adjust the grid structure based on viewport size.

Browser Compatibility: CSS Grid is well-supported in modern browsers, making it a reliable choice for layout design.

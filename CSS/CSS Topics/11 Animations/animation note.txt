# CSS Animations:
  CSS animations allow you to create more complex and dynamic animations. You can define keyframes with specific properties and values to control the animation's behaviour.

  CSS animations allow you to animate the transition of HTML elements from one style configuration to another. With keyframes and animation properties, you can create complex sequences of transformations, movements, and fades. 

Key Concepts:
  Keyframes: 
    Keyframes are defined animation stages with specific property values.
    Use the @keyframes rule to create keyframes with different percentages.

    Defines the animation. You specify the starting and ending points (and optionally intermediate points) of the animation using percentages (`0%` to `100%`) or keywords (`from` and `to`).
    Example:
        @keyframes slide-in {
          0% {
            transform: translateX(-100%);
          }
          100% {
            transform: translateX(0);
          }
        }

  Animation Property:
    The animation property is used to apply an animation to an element.
    You specify the animation name, duration, timing function, delay, iteration count, direction, and fill mode.

  - `animation-name`: Specifies the name of the keyframe you want to use.

  animation: 
    Name duration timing-function delay iteration-count direction fill-mode;

  Animation Duration:
    The duration property sets the length of the animation in seconds (s) or milliseconds (ms).
    Example: animation: slide-in 1s ease;
    Defines how long the animation should take to complete one cycle.

  Iteration Count:
    Specifies how many times the animation should repeat.
    Common values include infinite, 1, 2, etc.

  Direction:
    Defines whether the animation should play forwards (normal), backwards (reverse), or alternate (alternate) between forwards and backwards.

  Fill Mode:
    Determines what styles should be applied before and after the animation.
    Common values include forwards, backwards, both, and none.

  - `animation-timing-function`: Specifies the speed curve (e.g., `ease`, `linear`, `ease-in`, `ease-out`).

  - `animation-delay`: Specifies when the animation should start.


  Animation Example:
              /* Define a keyframe animation */
              @keyframes fade-in {
                0% {
                  opacity: 0;
                }
                100% {
                  opacity: 1;
                }
              }
              /* Apply the animation to an element */
              #animated-element {
                animation: fade-in 1s ease-in-out 0.2s infinite alternate;
              }

      
### Syntax:

                  @keyframes animation-name {
                    /* Keyframes */
                    from {
                      /* Initial styles */
                    }
                    to {
                      /* Final styles */
                    }
                  }

                  .element {
                    animation-name: animation-name;
                    animation-duration: duration;
                    animation-timing-function: timing-function;
                    animation-delay: delay;
                    animation-iteration-count: count;
                    animation-direction: direction;
                  }

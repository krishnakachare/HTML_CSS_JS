    <!-- 
    The <option> tag can be used without any attributes, but you usually need the value attribute, which indicates what is sent to the server on form submission. 

    selected:
    If present, this Boolean attribute indicates that the option is initially selected. If the <option> element is the descendant of a <select> element whose multiple attribute is not set, only one single <option> of this <select> element may have the selected attribute.
        
    value:
    The content of this attribute represents the value to be submitted with the form, should this option be selected. If this attribute is omitted, the value is taken from the text content of the option element.

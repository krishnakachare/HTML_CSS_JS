Block vs. Inline Elements:
Block Elements:
Block-level elements are used to create structural divisions or blocks in the content of a web page.
They typically start on a new line and extend the full width of their parent container.
Common block-level elements include <div>, <p>, <h1> to <h6>, <ul>, <ol>, <li>, <table>, <form>, and
more.
Example:
<div>This is a block-level element.</div>
<p>This is another block-level element.</p>
<h1>This is a heading, which is also a block-level element.</h1>
Inline Elements:
Inline elements are used to style or wrap specific portions of text within a block-level element.
They do not start on a new line and only occupy the space needed for their content.
Common inline elements include <span>, <a>, <strong>, <em>, <abbr>, <img>, and more.
Example:
<p>This is a <em>portion of text</em> within a paragraph.</p>
<span>This is an inline element.</span>

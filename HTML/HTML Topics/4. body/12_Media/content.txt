## Media Elements:
    - Embedding images (img)
    - Using audio (audio) and video (video) elements
    - Attributes and controls for multimedia
============================================================
### Media Elements in HTML5:
    HTML5 introduced powerful multimedia capabilities, allowing developers to embed images, audio, and video directly into web pages without relying on external plugins.

### 1. Embedding Images (`<img>` Element):
    The `<img>` element is used to display images in web pages.

#### Basic Example:
<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/150" alt="Placeholder Image" width="150" height="150">
````````````````````````````````````````````````

#### Common Attributes:
    - `src`: Specifies the image file URL.
    - `alt`: Provides alternative text for accessibility and SEO.
    - `width` / `height`: Defines the dimensions of the image.
    - `title`: Displays a tooltip when the user hovers over the image.
    - `loading`: Controls lazy loading (`lazy`, `eager`).

#### Example with `loading` Attribute:
    <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/500" alt="Large Image" width="500" height="300" loading="lazy">
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````
### 2. Using Audio (`<audio>` Element):
The `<audio>` element allows embedding audio files.

#### Basic Example:
    <audio controls>
        <source src="example-audio.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
        Your browser does not support the audio element.
    </audio>
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````
#### Attributes:
    - `controls`: Displays playback controls like play, pause, and volume.
    - `autoplay`: Starts playing the audio automatically (muted autoplay may be required for some browsers).
    - `loop`: Plays the audio file in a loop.
    - `muted`: Starts the audio muted.
    - `preload`: Specifies how the audio should be loaded (`none`, `metadata`, `auto`).

#### Example with Multiple Formats:
    <audio controls>
        <source src="example-audio.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
        <source src="example-audio.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
        Your browser does not support the audio element.
    </audio>
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````
### 3. Using Video (`<video>` Element):
The `<video>` element is used to embed video files.

#### Basic Example
    <video width="640" height="360" controls>
        <source src="example-video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        Your browser does not support the video tag.
    </video>
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````
#### Attributes
    - `controls`: Adds video playback controls like play, pause, and volume.
    - `autoplay`: Starts playing the video automatically (requires muted autoplay for most browsers).
    - `loop`: Loops the video after it ends.
    - `muted`: Mutes the video by default.
    - `poster`: Specifies an image to display while the video is loading or until the user plays it.
    - `preload`: Specifies loading behavior (`none`, `metadata`, `auto`).

#### Example with Poster and Loop:
    <video width="640" height="360" controls loop poster="poster-image.jpg">
        <source src="example-video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        <source src="example-video.ogg" type="video/ogg">
        Your browser does not support the video tag.
    </video>
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
### 4. Attributes and Controls for Multimedia

    | Attribute | Applies to | Description                             |
    |---------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------|
    | `controls`    | `<audio>`, `<video>` | Adds playback controls.                   |
    | `autoplay`    | `<audio>`, `<video>` | Starts playback automatically.            |
    | `loop`        | `<audio>`, `<video>` | Loops the media when it ends.             |
    | `muted`       | `<audio>`, `<video>` | Mutes the media by default.               |
    | `preload`     | `<audio>`, `<video>` | Controls how media is loaded.             |
    | `poster`      | `<video>`            | Specifies an image to show before playback.|

#### Example Combining Attributes:
    <video width="640" height="360" controls autoplay loop muted preload="auto" poster="poster-image.jpg">
        <source src="example-video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        Your browser does not support the video tag.
    </video>

### 5. Accessibility and Best Practices:
        1. Provide Alternative Text for Images: Use the `alt` attribute for accessibility and SEO.
        2. Fallback Content for Audio and Video: Include a message for unsupported browsers.
        3. Optimize File Sizes:
        - Compress images, audio, and videos for faster loading.
        - Use modern formats (e.g., WebP for images, MP4 for videos).
        4. Responsive Design:
        - Use CSS to ensure images, audio, and videos adapt to different screen sizes.
        - Example:
                ```css
                img, video {
                    max-width: 100%;
                    height: auto;
                }
